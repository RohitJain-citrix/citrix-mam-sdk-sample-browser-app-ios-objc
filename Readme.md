## Description
This repository contains the iOS Objective-C source code for a sample browser app that uses the MAM SDKs for endpoint management.  It does not contain the [MAM SDK](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-mam-sdks/) libraries themselves, which are downloaded separately.

## Download
The MAM SDK libraries can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-mam-sdks/). They are pre-compiled.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use this sample app, and compile it, see the [MAM SDK for iOS and iPadOS Overview](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/mam-sdk-for-ios-and-ipados/docs/overview).  Documentation is also included in the MAM SDK download package.

Note that some files need to be copied into the "Frameworks", "Tools", and "Data" folders from the iOS MAM SDK zip file.
