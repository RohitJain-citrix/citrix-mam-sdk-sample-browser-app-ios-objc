## Description
This repository contains the iOS Objective-C source code for a sample browser app that uses the MAM SDKs for endpoint management.  It does not contain the [MAM SDK](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) libraries themselves, which are downloaded separately.

## Download
The MAM SDK libraries can be downloaded from [MAM SDKs and Toolkit](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html).

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use this sample app, and compile it, see the [MAM SDK for iOS and iPadOS Overview](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/mam-sdk-for-ios-and-ipados/docs/overview).  Documentation is also included in the MAM SDK download package.
